I’ve been struggling to keep up with my classes lately. It feels like no matter how hard I try, I’m always behind.

I can’t seem to focus on studying, and I’m constantly worried about failing. My grades are slipping, and I don’t know what to do.

My friends don’t really understand how stressed I am. They just keep telling me to take it easy, but it’s not that simple.

Sometimes I wonder if I’m in the right major. Maybe I’m just not cut out for this. I feel so lost and unsure of everything.
